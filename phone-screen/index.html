<li>I graduated university with a degree in English but got interested in China and <strong>after graduation I moved to China</strong> to learn the language.</li>
<li>Once my Chinese was good, <strong>I worked for Johns Hopkins University</strong> in a Chinese-speaking role.</li>
<li>While I worked for JHU, I paired up with my friend <a href="https://www.drorpoleg.com/">Dror</a> and <strong>operated a media startup called Buy Buy China</strong> to consult on consumer-facing Chinese tech companies.</li>
