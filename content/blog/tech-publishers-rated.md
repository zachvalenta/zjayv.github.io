Ultimately, it's the book. Forsenic Discovery is awesome, even though its publisher (Addison-Wesley) doesn't even surface the book on their site https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/series/Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing-Series/334583.html and even though the parent company (Pearson) is busy charging undergrads $200 for a bio textbook.

# 🟩 GREAT

## blogs

* Heaton on HTTPS, Vincent on Django

## Manning

* books I like from them: Grokking Algorithms
* volume
* breadcrumb notation (not on Grokking though)
* video series seem like cash grab on their most popular titles vs. actually doing some sort of interactive visualization

LIVEBOOK
* ✅ super fast customer svc, asked "how can I view my annotations?" and got an email response in 15 minutes
* ❌ notebook: access through main menu
* ❌ toasters that you cant x out of, need page reload to banish
* `h` highlight `n` note `b` bookmark
> ❌ couldn't get this to work even after Vimium config -> try again after browser restart
> ❌ no obvious way to see if you've highlighted something in a book -> 'this notebook' from the sidebar

## No Starch

* owned by Penguin? https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/565590/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true-by-daniel-higginbotham/
* books I like from them: LPI
* DRM-free
* fun!
* customer service
* limited selection

# 🟨 GOOD

## O'Reilly

* DRM dark side (used to be free...) https://github.com/AlisdairO/pgexercises/pull/50/files
* editing: Flask Web Dev, SQLAlchemy (Grinberg seems like a good guy, btw)
* no line numbers (other guys do this)
* breadcrumb notation (what is this really called?)
* walled garden (not to say they don't have good stuff; PluralSight is same and their Python course is awesome)
* quantity over quality to feed the Safari grist mill
* quality control e.g. terms not in index: Bradshaw 162, 163, 173, 188/193, 161

## Pragmatic Press

* books I like from them: Vim, SQL Anti-Patterns
* https://pragprog.com/titles/d-dselena/dear-elena/
* esoteric
* customer service
https://pragprog.com/support/index.html#new-site

## Youtube

* best for video but PluralSight will continue to make money bc large corporations want to have CERTIFIED TRAINING OPTIONS (PG essay) in the same way that the military will spend $5k on a toilet
