Ultimately, it's the book. Forsenic Discovery is awesome, even though its publisher (Addison-Wesley) doesn't even surface the book on their site https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/series/Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing-Series/334583.html and even though the parent company (Pearson) is busy charging undergrads $200 for a bio textbook.

✅ No Starch

* books I like from them: LPI
* DRM-free
* fun!
* customer service
* limited selection

❌ O'Reilly

* DRM dark side (used to be free...) https://github.com/AlisdairO/pgexercises/pull/50/files
* editing: Flask Web Dev, SQLAlchemy (Grinberg seems like a good guy, btw)
* no line numbers (other guys do this)
* breadcrumb notation (what is this really called?)
* walled garden (not to say they don't have good stuff; PluralSight is same and their Python course is awesome)
* quantity over quality to feed the Safari grist mill
* quality control e.g. terms not in index: Bradshaw 162, 163, 173, 188/193, 161

🆗 Manning

* books I like from them: Grokking Algorithms
* volume
* breadcrumb notation (not on Grokking though)
* video series seem like cash grab on their most popular titles vs. actually doing some sort of interactive visualization

📺 PluralSight

* if you want to become a Microsoft MVP or do 47 hours of AWS training...
* search is bad: 'alchemy' does not return course on SQLAlchemy

📺 Youtube

* best for video but PluralSight will continue to make money bc large corporations want to have CERTIFIED TRAINING OPTIONS (PG essay) in the same way that the military will spend $5k on a toilet

📺 Udemy

* Janetakis

📰 blogs

* Heaton on HTTPS, Vincent on Django
