<p>bullshit = prioritization of the affective over <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/06/socratic-grilling/">attempts (however asymptotic) at coherence</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the point is rather that, so far as wittgenstein can see, pascal offers a description of a certain state of affairs without genuinely submitting to the constraints which the endeavor to provide an accurate representation of reality imposes. her fault is not that she fails to get things right, but that she is not even trying.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>these "anti-realist" doctrines undermine confidence in the value of disinterested efforts to determine what is true and what is false, and even in the intelligibility of the notion of objective inquiry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>our natures are, indeed, elusively insubstantial — notoriously less stable and less inherent than the natures of other things. and insofar as this is the case, sincerity itself is bullshit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-bother">why bother?</h2>
<p>much of public life is bullshit-centric. a better handle on much of public life is helpful.</p>

<p>bullshit is more pernicious than lying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a person who lies is thereby responding to the truth, and he is to that extent respectful of it. when an honest man speaks, he says only what he believes to be true; and for the liar, it is correspondingly indispensable that he considers his statements to be false. for the bullshitter, however, all these bets are off: he is neither on the side of the true nor on the side of the false. his eye is not on the facts at all, as the eyes of the honest man and of the liar are, except insofar as they may be pertinent to his interest in getting away with what he says. he does not care whether the things he says describe reality correctly. he just picks them out, or makes them up, to suit his purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>current events is a locus of bullshit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bullshit is unavoidable whenever circumstances require someone to talk without knowing what he is talking about. thus the production of bullshit is stimulated whenever a person’s obligations or opportunities to speak about some topic are more excessive than his knowledge of the facts that are relevant to that topic...closely related instances arise from the widespread conviction that it is the responsibility of a citizen in a democracy to have opinions about everything, or at least everything that pertains to the conduct of his country’s affairs.</p>
